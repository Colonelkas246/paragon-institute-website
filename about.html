I, a highschool student with a passion in coding and the desire to
help students with their high school and primary school studies have
created and designed a platform and started a business in the name of
Paragon institute. Experiences faced by me outline the insufficient help
and poor guidance in relation to my test and exam preparation in my
schooling journey. With no information and assitance, I have researched
the relative information and details by myself and gathered educational
material to successfully gain a place at Suzanne Cory High School
(one of the four selective schools of Victoria). With all of these in
mind, I do not wish for students in my past shoes to face a series of 
problems and confusion and this is where Paragon will come to the rescue.
